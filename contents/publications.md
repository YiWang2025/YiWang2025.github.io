### Data Analyst, Geological Survey of Canada - Calgary, 2025.01 - 2025.03
*   Extracted, cleaned, and preprocessed well log data stored in Log ASCII Standard (LAS) files using Python libraries such as lasio and pandas to generate consistent datasets for analysis. 
*   Applied advanced statistical analyses and unsupervised learning techniques in R, including linear and nonlinear regression models, principal component analysis (PCA), and clustering methods, to investigate complex relationships among geochemical and petrophysical variables using packages such as ISLR, car, MASS, tree, and leaps; used established models to predict target geochemical properties.
*   Produced clear and insightful visualizations and reports using ggplot2, cowplot, and Excel to effectively communicate findings to supervisors and geoscientists, integrating data findings into broader geological models and interpretations. 


### Data Analyst, Geological Survey of Canada - Calgary, 2024.02 - 2024.07
*   Collected and compiled geological and petroleum data from various sources, including thermal conductivity measurements on core samples, as well as well log and related information from industrial, academic, and government databases and websites, to support geological analysis.
*   Cleaned and standardized well log datasets using R (dplyr, stringr, readr) and Excel (VLOOKUP, filters, SUMIF); merged datasets by well ID and depth; corrected mislabeled information; and handled missing or duplicate records. 
*   Contributed to the Carbon Capture, Usage, and Storage Program (CCUS) by providing statistical perspectives to advance geological research.
